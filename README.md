# Linked-List

## What does it do
This program demonstrates the usage of a linked list data structure in Java. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
In this program, the linked list is used to store and manipulate Book objects. The program showcases various operations that can be performed on a linked list, including:
- Adding elements to the linked list at the head and tail using the newHead and newTail methods.
- Printing the contents of the linked list using the print method.
- Checking if the linked list is empty using the isEmpty method.
- Retrieving the size of the linked list using the size method.
- Deleting a specific element from the linked list using the deleteItem method.
- Deleting the head and tail elements of the linked list using the deleteHead and deleteTail methods.
- Searching for an element in the linked list using the contains method.
- Clearing the linked list using the clear method.
By running this program, you can observe how the linked list behaves and see the results of these operations in action. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications that require linked list-like behavior, such as maintaining a dynamic collection of data, implementing a queue or stack, or managing a linked list of tasks or events.
